This project explores the use of a massive number of antennas at a cognitive base station (BS) to reduce interference to primary users (PUs) under incomplete or imperfect channel state information (CSI), while maintaining the sum spectral efficiency of cognitive users (CUs). Key contributions include deriving analytical expressions for interference outage probability and sum spectral efficiency under imperfect CSI. The study shows that deploying more antennas can reduce interference without degrading CU performance, and it highlights the impact of spatial correlation and the availability of CSI on network performance. The work is applicable to optimizing cognitive radio networks, and future research could extend to other beamforming techniques and machine learning approaches for better CSI estimation.
